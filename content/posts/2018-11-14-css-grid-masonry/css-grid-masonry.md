Back in early January, [Wes Bos](https://github.com/wesbos) asked [Rachel Andrew](https://github.com/rachelandrew) the excellent [question](https://github.com/rachelandrew/cssgrid-ama/issues/19) if CSS grid could be used to produce a masonry layout (think Pinterest). Turns out the spec doesn't support it. Makes sense if you think about. A proper masonry layout doesn't have rows and without rows, it's not a grid. Still it would have been cool if CSS grid had you covered, anyway. At least for now though, that is late 2018, almost 2 years after the question. It still doesn't.

No matter though. That just means we have to get a little creative. And indeed, that's exactly what [Jamie Perkins](https://github.com/inorganik) did. In the above linked GitHub issue, he [presents a neat flexbox solution](https://codepen.io/inorganik/pen/pREYPJ) that requires just 13 lines of JavaScript.

I took the liberty to rewrite his approach in more modern JS. That shaved another 4 lines, bringing it down to just 9:

```javascript
const numCols = 3
const colHeights = Array(numCols).fill(0)
const container = document.getElementById('container')
Array.from(container.children).forEach((child, i) => {
  const order = i % numCols
  child.style.order = order
  colHeights[order] += parseFloat(child.clientHeight)
})
container.style.height = Math.max(...colHeights) + 'px'
```

However, flexbox gave some trouble. The `flex` items kept disregarding the parent container width, causing massive overflows. Not pretty and I couldn't get them to behave.

So I really wanted to make it happen with `grid` instead. If you're using **`react`** and **`styled-components`**, the suggested solution by Rachel Andrews, which is to make the row height $h_\text{r}$ relative to the height of a typical grid item $h_\text{item}$ and make each grid item take up $n = \lceil h_\text{r}/h_\text{item}\rceil$ rows, is quite easy to implement:

```javascript
// Masonry.js
import React, { Component } from 'react'

import { Parent, Child } from './styles'

export default class Masonry extends Component {
  state = { spans: [], ref: React.createRef() }

  componentDidMount() {
    const node = this.state.ref.current
    const spans = []
    Array.from(node.children).forEach(child => {
      console.log(child.clientHeight)
      spans.push(Math.ceil(child.clientHeight / this.props.rowHeight))
    })
    this.setState({ spans })
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <Parent ref={this.state.ref} {...this.props}>
        {this.props.children.map((child, i) => (
          <Child key={i} span={this.state.spans[i]}>
            {child}
          </Child>
        ))}
      </Parent>
    )
  }
}

Masonry.defaultProps = {
  rowHeight: 50, // in pixels
  colWidth: 15em,
}
```

and the styled components:

```javascript
// styles.js
import styled from 'styled-components'

export const Parent = styled.div`
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(
    auto-fit,
    minmax(${props => props.colWidth}, 1fr)
  );
  grid-auto-rows: calc(${props => props.rowHeight}px - 2em);
  grid-gap: 2em;
`

export const Child = styled.div`
  grid-row: span ${props => props.span};
  height: max-content;
`
```

There you go. All you need to do, is copy the above two files into your project, change the default props for `rowHeight` and `colWidth` to suit your needs and use the masonry component something like so:

```javascript
import React from 'react'

import Masonry from '../Masonry'
import PostExcerpt from '../PostExcerpt'

const PostList = ({ posts }) => (
  <Masonry>
    {posts.map(post => (
      <PostExcerpt key={post.slug} {...post} />
    ))}
  </Masonry>
)

export default PostList
```
