Deep learning is a class of adaptable (as opposed to task-specific) machine learning algorithms for learning data representations. Deep learning models consist of a chain of non-linear processing units called layers. Each successive layer uses the output from the previous layer as input, thereby learning multiple levels of representations corresponding to different levels of abstraction. Deep learning thus gives rise to a hierarchy of concepts in terms of which to ``understand'' the data.

In this sense, deep learning follows the reductionist approach of science which understands reality in terms of different levels of abstraction ranging from quantum mechanics at the very bottom from which is reconciled with the macroscopic thermodynamic laws through statistical mechanics. and particularly that of renormalization as developed in high-energy physics which generates effective descriptions of macroscopic physics (high level of abstraction) by integrating out the microscopic laws of fundamental degrees of freedom corresponding to the bottom of the hierarchy of concepts in deep learning \cite{mehta_exact_2014,beny_deep_2013}.
