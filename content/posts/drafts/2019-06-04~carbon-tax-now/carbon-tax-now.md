Climate change is one of the most pressing concerns facing humanity in the 21st century. The steady rise in average global temperatures, the increasing frequency and severity of weather extremes, the Fridays for Future movement and the growing discontent with the ineffective and lackluster climate policies of previous decades as evidenced by the never-before-seen popularity of green parties in the recent EU election, particularly among the German, French and British electorate, are clear indicators that our time for action is running short.

Notice that, for the first time the entire climate debate began many decades ago, the above list contains the first signs of civil unrest as a motivation to act quickly. That is remarkable in and of itself as it suggests that for the first time, it could politically viable for a popular party to propose climate policies that really have the scope and far-reaching implications to make a significant impact. What am I talking about here? The silver bullet for fighting global warming: a **carbon tax**.

As capitalists like to emphasize, we have this amazing, self-balancing economic system that automatically ensures supply grows with demand and competition clears away the unfit. The only problem is, it operates in an environment of unpriced externalities, foremost among them our planet. The environment we live and thrive in. This is a literally priceless public good, yet in many areas of our economy and daily life, we allow everyone to enrich themselves by decimating this public good as they see fit. This is where political regulation -- now more than ever -- urgently needs to step in by enforcing a -- ideally global, but in the first instance more realistically solely European -- carbon tax. This would finally put everyone, electric and gasoline cars, trains and airplanes, renewable and fossil-fuel-based energy generation on an equal playing field (provided we get rid of fossil-fuel subisides as well). This would allow us to leverage the full transformative force of competitive selection that rewards efficient and innovative companies and penalizes the ones clinging to outdated technologies that hurt us all.
